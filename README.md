# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Project Description
This is the first step towards building a full web application: an AirBnB clone. This project covers the foundational concepts of Python, including OOP, serialization/deserialization to JSON, and unit testing. The goal is to create a command interpreter (console) to manage our application objects.

## Command Interpreter
The console allows you to:
- Create new objects (e.g., BaseModel, User, State, etc.)
- Retrieve objects from a file
- Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

### How to Start
To start the console in interactive mode:
```bash
$ ./console.py
